	title = {International monetary policy coordination: past, present and future},
	abstract = {This paper examines two explanations for the recent spate of complaints about cross-border monetary policy spillovers and calls for international monetary policy coordination, a development that contrasts sharply with the monetary system in the 1980s, 1990s and until recently. The first explanation holds that deviations from rules-based policy at several central banks created incentives for other central banks to deviate from such policies. The second explanation either does not see deviations from rules or finds such deviations benign; it characterises recent unusual monetary policies as appropriate, explains the complaints as an adjustment to optimal policies, and downplays concerns about interest rate differentials and capital controls. Going forward, the goal for central banks should be an expanded rulesbased system similar to that of the 1980s and 1990s, which would operate near an international cooperative equilibrium. International monetary policy coordination – at least formal discussions of rules-based policies and the issues reviewed here –would help central banks get such equilibrium.},

The Covid-19 episode saw the implementation of monetary-fiscal policy coordination not seen since the 1970s to avert catastrophic damage to economies caused by pandemic-induced lockdowns. Recent developments suggest these were best understood as emergency short-term responses rather than marking a shift in the consensus that insists on a separation between monetary and fiscal policy spheres that might support a more coordinated policy approach to addressing environmental breakdown. We review the most prominent examples of coordination in high income and emerging market economies in the 2020-2021 period, focussing on the creation of fiscal space and targeted provision of liquidity to strategic sectors of the economy. We consider the lessons and opportunities these policy innovations raise for the development of a precautionary macroeconomic policy approach which seeks to reduce the threat of ecological tipping points, prevent catastrophic losses, and support the Net-Zero transition.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we assess the inﬂuence of monetary policy on the bank-lending channel in both pre- and post-2007 ﬁnancial crisis periods. In constructing the monetary policy instrument, we used both conventional and unconventional measures, the latter being the asset purchases ratio in the central banks’ balance sheets. In the pre-crisis subperiod, the bank- lending channel operated effectively in response to changes in central banks’ rates. In the post-crisis sub-period, however, this traditional mechanism was distorted. The effect of unconventional measures on the banks’ behavior, however, was statistically signiﬁcant. Our results suggest that an increase in asset purchases by central banks reduced the ﬁnancial institutions’ balance sheet dependence to extend ﬁnancing. Consequently, we infer that the implementation of unconventional monetary policy measures was effective in stimulating credit growth in the post-crisis sub-period.},

@article{avdjiev_shifting_nodate,
	title = {The shifting drivers of global liquidity},
	abstract = {The post-crisis period has seen a considerable shift in the composition and drivers of international bank lending and international bond issuance, the two main components of global liquidity. The sensitivity of both types of flow to {US} monetary policy rose substantially in the immediate aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, peaked around the time of the 2013 Fed “taper tantrum”, and then partially reverted towards pre-crisis levels. Conversely, the responsiveness of international bank lending to global risk conditions declined considerably post-crisis and became similar to that of international debt securities. The increased sensitivity of international bank flows to {US} monetary policy has been driven mainly by post-crisis changes in the behaviour of national lending banking systems, especially those that ex ante had less well capitalized banks. By contrast, the post-crisis fall in the sensitivity of international bank lending to global risk was mainly due to a compositional effect, driven by increases in the lending market shares of better-capitalized national banking systems. The post-2013 reversal in the sensitivities to {US} monetary policy partially reflects the expected divergence of the monetary policy of the {US} and other advanced economies, highlighting the sensitivity of capital flows to the degree of commonality of cycles and the stance of policy. Moreover, global liquidity fluctuations have largely been driven by policy initiatives in creditor countries. Policies and prudential instruments that reinforced lending banks’ capitalization and stable funding levels reduced the volatility of international lending flows.},

	abstract = {This paper demonstrates that in the post-2008 environment with interest on reserves, monetary policy actions can generate regime shifts that yield quantitatively and even qualitatively different responses of bank balance-sheet conﬁgurations and loan and deposit market outcomes to exogenous changes. In contrast to the view that a one-time structural change occurred in 2008, switching between several different regimes plausibly can arise depending upon settings of the reserve ratio, federal funds rate, and the interest rate on reserves. Our results explain stylized facts regarding excess reserves and interbank lending. Analysis with calibrated values indicates that such regime switching has occurred.},

	abstract = {Financial cycles can be important drivers of real activity, but there is scant evidence about how well they signal recession risks. We run a horse race between the term spread – the most widely used indicator in the literature – and a range of financial cycle measures. Unlike most papers, ours assesses forecasting performance not just for the United States but also for a panel of advanced and emerging market economies. We find that financial cycle measures have significant forecasting power both in and out of sample, even for a three-year horizon. Moreover, they outperform the term spread in nearly all specifications. These results are robust to different recession specifications.},

	abstract = {In a low-dimensional linear regression setup, considering linear transformations/ combinations of predictors does not alter predictions. However, when the forecasting technology either uses shrinkage or is nonlinear, it does. This is precisely the fabric of the machine learning ({ML}) macroeconomic forecasting environment. Pre-processing of the data translates to an alteration of the regularization – explicit or implicit –embedded in {ML} algorithms. We review old transformations and propose new ones, then empirically evaluate their merits in a substantial pseudo-out-sample exercise. It is found that traditional factors should almost always be included as predictors and moving average rotations of the data can provide important gains for various forecasting targets. Also, we note that while predicting directly the average growth rate is equivalent to averaging separate horizon forecasts when using {OLS}-based techniques, the latter can substantially improve on the former when regularization and/or nonparametric nonlinearities are involved.},
